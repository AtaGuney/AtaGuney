  My Journey to Becoming a QA Tester

This repository documents my transition into software testing, the concepts I am learning, the projects I am building, and the study plan I follow. My goal is to create a structured learning space for myself. Maybe this will become a useful reference for anyone starting in QA.

Why QA?

It appeals to me because it combines analytical thinking with systematic problem-solving. Software testing plays a crucial role in product quality, user experience, and overall reliability. For these reasons, I am aiming to specialize in Quality Assurance.
